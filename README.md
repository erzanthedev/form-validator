# 📝 Form Validator Project 📝

Welcome to my Form Validator project! In this project, I focused on creating a robust form validation system using HTML for structure, JavaScript for functionality, and CSS for styling.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

The main objective of this project was to learn how to build a form validator from a frontend perspective using JavaScript, with a strong emphasis on user interaction and animation.

## ✨ Purpose

This project aimed to achieve the following:

- **Event Listeners**: Implemented to listen for clicks and trigger various functions.
- **HTML Form Validation**: Utilized built-in HTML form validation features.
- **JavaScript Validation**: Enhanced validation with JavaScript using the constraint API method `checkValidity()`.
- **Frontend Data Handling**: Since this is a frontend-only project, the data collected from the user is not posted to a server. Instead, it is stored in an object and displayed in console upon successful validation and user registration.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Deepened my understanding of JavaScript by implementing form validation logic.
- **Event Handling**: Improved my ability to set up and manage event listeners for form interactions.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Enhanced skills in manipulating the DOM to create dynamic and interactive forms.
- **CSS Styling**: Applied CSS to ensure the form is visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **Validation Techniques**: Learned to combine HTML5 form validation with custom JavaScript validation for robust data validation.
